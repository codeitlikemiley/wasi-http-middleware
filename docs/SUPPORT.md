# Support matrix

This matrix describes `0.2.0-alpha.3`; it is not a stable-support promise.

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Final WASI 0.3 HTTP middleware | Alpha | Exact `wasi:http/middleware@0.3.0` |
| Rust build target | Build detail | `wasm32-wasip2` emits the component; public ABI is WASI 0.3 |
| Wasmtime 46.0.1 | Behavioral host | Composition, security, streaming, parity, concurrency, and soak runners |
| Spin 4.0.2 | Unsupported canary | Missing final `wasi:http@0.3.0` host resource implementations |
| Spin main `c34c584...` terminal | Experimental canary | Final terminal and outbound HTTP work; no tagged support claim |
| Spin main WAC composition | Blocked upstream | Default CPU-metrics hook panics; no-default-features build is diagnostic only |
| Spin revision `27451471...` | Unsupported canary | Native middleware remains March-RC WIT and cannot compose final components |
| WAC-precomposed final chain on Spin | Experimental, blocked | Requires a tagged host plus the composed-handler CPU-accounting fix |
| Other final-WASI hosts | ABI candidate | Must pass the complete contract before a support claim |
| Separate four-component chain | Implemented | Request ID, security, CORS, strict authn |
| Fused `secure-defaults` | Experimental | Golden-equivalent portable interoperability and conformance fixture |
| In-process `wasi-http-authn` | Alpha | Trusted-ingress and terminal-broker boundary using typed request extensions |
| Request/response streaming | Implemented | No application-body collection |
| Mid-stream frame then error | Implemented | First frame preserved before terminal error; separate immediate-error no-hang gate |
| Trailers | Forwarded, host-dependent | Attached to body-result future; client exposure depends on host protocol bridge |
| CORS preflight | Implemented | Exact allowlists; executes before authn |
| Required/optional authn | Implemented | Optional applies only to absent credentials |
| Versioned trusted context | Implemented | Bounded request-only base64url V1 envelope |
| Domain authorization | Application-owned | E.g. Leptos `ServerFn::middlewares()` |
| Disconnect/concurrency | Covered | Wasmtime recovery and concurrent-request contracts |
| Islands/split Wasm | Sibling integration | `leptos_wasi`; `/pkg/...` remains public at static boundary |
| WebSockets/upgrades | Not claimed | No component conformance coverage |
| WASIp2 HTTP middleware | Unsupported | Different synchronous handler contract |
| Redis/MQTT/cron/custom triggers | Unsupported | Require trigger-specific adapters |
| Static/range/cache policy | Out of scope | Fileserver/CDN/ingress responsibility |
| Distributed rate limiting | Out of scope | Requires shared host/service state |

Malformed host header blocks may be rejected before guest invocation and are
not a middleware parity surface. The authn broker is never sent method, path,
query, authority, cookies, or application body.

Stable promotion requires a final-WASI Spin host (if Spin support is claimed),
blocking performance budgets, signed release provenance under an approved CI
identity, scheduled memory plateau evidence, and no skipped production path.
